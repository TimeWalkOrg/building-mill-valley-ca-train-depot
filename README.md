# The Mill Valley Depot
87 Throckmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

In the 1920s, 87 Throckmorton Avenue was the home of Mill Valley’s North Shore (aka "Northwestern Pacific") Railroad station. The building was previously located near the intersection of Sunnyside and Miller Avenues and it was moved to this site circa 1903. In addition to being a terminal for the North Shore Railroad, the station was also the starting point for the Mt. Tamalpais & Muir Woods Railway or the “Mountain Railway”. This scenic railway transported tourists on a winding journey to the summit of Mt. Tamalpais. 

In the 1920s, the railroad station featured a ticket office and a newsstand. On the second floor were living quarters for the station manager. Outside, a train shed protected passengers from the elements as they waited for trains. Over the years, the design of the building would change and when commuter train service ceased in 1940, the station would become a bus depot for Pacific Greyhound buses. In 2017, the building is the home of the Depot Bookstore & Cafe.
